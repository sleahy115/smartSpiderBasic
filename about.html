	<h1>Welcome</h1>
	<div class="about-1">
		<p>Last year, I attended a business seminar. The panel of speakers outlined the ever-increasing list of state, federal, health and workmen’s comp expenses to employers. A few day later, I was seeking an accountant specializing in assisting with financials for a grant proposal. At the same time, I needed to find a competent and qualified person to help a friend assist her mother in the process of downsizing her life.
		 
		All of these needs collided, and I quickly realized there was no all-encompassing website that could help me. It was obvious: there was a need for a one-stop website where experienced consultants providing a broad variety of services could connect with clients who need expertise in business, not-for-profit, and lifestyle areas. Thus SmartSpider.net was born.
		 
		Just one year later, my dream is reality. SmartSpider.net is serious about connecting clients with consultants. We have a robust web site, social media, print and and digital marketing. We provide learning tools to both clients and professionals, and we host a variety of events so you can get to know one another face-to-face.
		 
		One place where you can get all of your consulting needs met - THAT'S SMART!

	<div class="about-2">
		<h2>Jane Bradley</h2>
	    <h3>Founder and CEO</h3>
	 	<p>
			Jane Bradley is a third generation New Mexican and has always had a deep and abiding love for her native state. Perhaps it is this love for all things New Mexican that led to the ambition to become the "Female Michelangelo of the West.” A BFA was the natural choice and after success as a studio artist and gallery owner in Santa Fe, Jane became intrigued by the processes of business. This interest leads to additional education, followed by other varying and successful business endeavors. The ability to teach and share has been ongoing and a constant in Jane's life.
	 
			Curiosity is the one word that most clearly defines Jane's life. This curiosity has led to many personal and professional successes. From moving to a small hamlet in Arkansas with prince charming - to becoming the Executive Director of the Genesis Business Incubator at the University of Arkansas - to moving on to Russia during perestroika and working with technology transfer - to returning to the much loved and missed New Mexico, each new challenge was attacked with enthusiasm and determination.
	 
			"Life has been an adventure and I have loved every minute," quotes Jane. "These unique talents that I was given - a voracious curiosity, the common sense of a rancher’s daughter, the determination to see projects through to a successful end and the ability to put people together for mutual benefit - have all led to the making of a joyous and fulfilling life."
	 
			And now…to be the founder of The Bradley Connection, LLC and Smartspider.net, a unique new website that connects a wide variety of consultants with those in need of their services, is the culmination and, yes, the pinnacle of life's lessons and achievements.

		<h2>Mary Herrera</h2>
		<h3>Chief Financial Officer</h3>
		<p>
			Mary Herrera has a successful track record, working over 38 years as a public servant in New Mexico State, local and in the private sector. She has strong management skills, as well as a significant experience in administration of human resources and accounting, budget and finance. She completed her four-year term as New Mexico Secretary of State in December 2010. During her tenure as Secretary of State, she was the second highest-ranking Hispanic elected official in the country and the highest-ranking state elected Hispanic woman in the United States.
	 
			After graduating from West Mesa High School, she went on to receive her Bachelor’s and Master’s Degrees in Business Administration from the College of Santa Fe. When invited to give the commencement speech to the 2007 graduating class, Herrera was presented with an Honorary Doctorate in Humane Letters from the College of Santa Fe. Additionally, she received a Certificate of Program Administration for Senior Executives from the John F. Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University, Certificates in Labor, Employment, and Benefits Law from the Institute for Applied Management, and the Credit Union League. In 2007, Herrera was selected as one of forty recipients to the prestigious Henry Toll Fellowship Program (Council of State Governments), consisting of the top 40 emerging state leaders representing all three branches of government for her leadership ability.

		<h2>Michael Arner</h2>
		<h3>Director of Technology</h3>
		<p>
			A longtime interdisciplinarian, Michael Arner received his B.S. in Mathematics and Computer Science from Carnegie Mellon University and his Ph.D. in English Literature from Boston University. He has published essays on art and technology in both academic and popular presses. In addition to his software enterprises (RoamData, the most successful of the half-dozen companies he has co-founded, was sold to Ingenico earlier this year), he has taught film, literature, and drama at Boston University and at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. In 1999, his play, "The Silk Road," was produced by Sara Arlin and the Chinese Culture Institute at Boston's New Tremont Theatre.
	 
			After almost a quarter-century spent back east, Michael returned to his hometown, Albuquerque, in the summer of 2011, extensive library, a few shamefully non-native plants, cats, three-quarters of a novel, and the artist, Dasha Alexandrova, in tow. He feels extremely fortunate to be back in the Land of Enchantment and to have connected with the dazzling and delightful SmartSpider.net Gang.
